Allows you to convert the post type of objects while in the edit screen.

== Description ==

Adds meta boxes to all post types and allows you to convert the post type of the current post you are editing to a different post type. This very useful when doing an import from another site into one post type that then needs to be filtered into different post types or even to fill dummy posts throughout multiple post types.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload entire post-type-converter directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. For each Post Type, even custom, you will see a new meta box on the top right corner of the edit screen so you can easily change the select box and click update.
